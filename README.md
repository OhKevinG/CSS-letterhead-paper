# CSS-LETTERHEAD-PAPER

This is an example of how to use CSS to style a webpage.

## REFLECTION

I had a good bit of fun with this project as it was quite challenging and I learned a lot about how to develop a webpage with complex CSS. I couldn't get the page to look exactly like I wanted to, but I believe I met all the requirements. I had to use the mozilla web development site a lot as well as use some of the source code on the Lorem Ipsum generator for the body. This was super nice though as I god some really good experience with using developer tools on the browser. 

## DEVELOPMENT

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
